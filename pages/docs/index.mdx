# Meticulous Quickstart

Meticulous recorder is a tool for recording real user sessions. The recorder captures your users' actions and any network requests (and responses) during their session. Please note that although plaintext passwords are redacted, the recorded network requests can include authorization tokens and other headers -- you should therefore only add trusted users to your Meticulous organization. You can either add the recorder to all environments or just internal non-production environments.

## Installation
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Steps>
### Sign up

    Sign up at [https://app.meticulous.ai/signup](https://app.meticulous.ai/signup). You will be prompted to create an organization and project.

### Install the Meticulous recorder

Navigate to Your Project in the Meticulous app and copy the below JavaScript snippet and paste it into the `<head>` tag of your site.

```html copy
<head>
  ...
  <script
    data-project-id="<RECORDING_TOKEN>"
    data-is-production-environment="<true/false>"
    src="https://snippet.meticulous.ai/v1/meticulous.js"
  ></script>

  <!--Meticulous snippet should be added before your app -->
  ...
</head>
```

This snippet loads the Meticulous SDK onto the page.

### Validating installation

    Once you add the Meticulous snippet open your webapp (either locally or on the environment that you injected the snippet into) and record a session by clicking around on your web app.

If the snippet was installed successfully you should be able to view the recorded session in your [Meticulous dashboard](https://app.meticulous.ai/) in the Sessions section.
